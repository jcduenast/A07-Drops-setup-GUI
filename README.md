# A07-Drops-setup-GUI
GUI in VB to control the movement of the different elements in the setup.

This new version will be further improved. The main change is the format of commands. Now the serial commands are as follows:

* Camera group: _CX, _CY, C_Z
* Drops height: _ZD
* Cofocal sensor: _SX, _SY, _SZ
* Wave generator: _WX, _WY, _WZ

The software and firmware are then incompatble between the archive and main branch versions.
